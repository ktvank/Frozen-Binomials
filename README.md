This is a small starter that will get you started parsing binomials. In this case we use Reddit data, but the principal applies to other forms of text data and this guide should not require too much modification to use other sorts of data. We present both the  all words method and the names only method.

To set up, please place the "comment" Reddit files in the comments folder. Place you post file in posts.json in the main folder. If you have only one comment file, we recommend you break it up due to size. These files should be in the form of json separated by returns, with all metadata attached. Additionally, you will need a csv file with a column called 'names' that provide a list of names that you want to search for for name lists. Small example files are included.

To run this, please first run get_all_words_lists.json and get_name_lists_from_reddit.py. Then run filter_all_words.py and basic_plotting.py to get the initial plots and data files output. For the plots, we only analyze lists that have at least 30 instances. Feel free to change the cutoff to suit your needs. The percent first plots and the ordinality histograms are both typcially bell curves. The list output files can be used for further analysis of your binomials.
