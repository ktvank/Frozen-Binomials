Wrong answer. Democrats say \"Go right now.\" Wrong answer. It is a much more complicated issue than that. I believe the answer must involve a combination of nuance, compromise and common-sense.\n*Admit the Iraq war is a disaster.\n*Admit post-war planning was a disaster.\n*Admit it's a civil war in Iraq- and our boys do not belong in the middle of a civil war. Our troops are not policeman.\n*Use the success of the surge to declare victory and make plans to get out of Iraq as soon as reasonably possible.\n\n*Learn the lesson that \"Nation Building\" is a failure of epic proportions- we are not the world's policeman. We do not have the right to stuff our beliefs of Democracy down the throats of other countries around the globe. Even if we did, Iraq proves we cannot afford it.\n\n*One more lesson: Government wastes money. Government by its nature is corrupt. The military-industrial complex wants to expand government to increase its power and influence. We need strict oversight over defense contractors and private companies like Haliburton and Blackwater. Even during a time of war, I do not find it acceptable to allow our tax dollars to be wasted, or American taxpayers to be taken advantage of. Corporate welfare and waste is just as bad (and expensive) as welfare and entitlements for private citizens.\n\n*Let's keep our military and national defense strong. One way to ensure this is to dramatically reduce foreign aid (especially to our enemies) and foreign military bases across the globe.\n\n*It is time for South Korea, Japan and Western Europe to take responsibility (and pay) for their own national defense.\n\n*Let's use the savings from these cuts in defense spending to increase the pay of our courageous U.S. military personnel.\n\n \n\n\"The legacy I want to leave is simple and straight-forward. I want to be known as the man who took the power away from the government and gave it back to the people. Who cut government down to size. Who took the side of the individuals versus government. Who let the taxpayers keep more of their own money. Who rewarded the people that produced all the wealth, started the businesses, took the risks, created the jobs, made the payrolls, and paid the taxes. Who cared about the rights, freedoms and liberty of the people. Who protected the constitution. Who made all Americans, Libertarians.\"\n--Wayne Allyn Root\n\n\nI don't have a major beef with the stated positions above.

Underworld Cartels such as the Mafia, supplying various underworld products and services.  Mechanism of the Monopoly: they break your kneecaps if you try to compete with them.  (No government, despite the sincere efforts of most, has ever succeeded in maintaining a monopoly on the use of force).\n\n2. Some utilities supplying pure undifferentiated commodities such as electricity, intra-city-transit, or water.  Mechanism of the Monopoly: The demand is finite, and the cost of entry into the market is massive involving the creation of an entire subway tunnel system, electrical grid, or plumbing network. See the above link concerning Natural Monopolies for more detailed information on this sort of monopoly.\n\n3. Technological monopolies supplying highly unique goods.  Mechanism of the Monopoly: Trade secrets.  This is really a special form of a Natural Monopoly, except in this case the barrier to entry isn't an expensive and massive infastructure but the exclusive control of key data needed to create a competing product.  Good examples include recombinant industrial enzymes.\n\n\nBecause these non-government granted monopolies exist, they constitute disproof of the proposition that \"a monopoly is government-granted special privilege\" by counter example.", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null, "subreddit": "Libertarian", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "created_utc": "1212007512", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63"}

Natural Monopolies, which one can probably find referenced in most any introductory micro-economics text book, are a well known phenomenon the existence of which is NOT CONTESTED by ANYONE.  \n\nTo suggest that **ALL** Monopolies are the result of non-market forces is worse than merely making a semantic point upon the false assumption that the English word has not evolved in meaning since the days of the ancient Greeks.  To make this assertion is unscientific... it ignores FACTS... facts like Natural Monopolies.  In truth the Mafia was my WORST example, because it was the one that didn't involve a Natural Monopoly.  It doesn't matter that we don't look upon such monopolies with the same \"bad connotations\" as we do government monopolies.  *All I'm saying* is that Monopolies that come into being as a result of Market Forces (such as those based upon trade-secrets or other barriers to entry into an industry) ACTUALLY EXIST!", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t1_c045uk4", "link_id": "t3_6kyzg", "name": "t1_c0460pl", "score": 1, "id": "c0460pl"}
