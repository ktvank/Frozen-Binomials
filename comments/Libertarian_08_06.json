{"body": "&gt;How, then, do Barr and Root stack up on these two questions. At the convention, neither would clearly and unambiguously commit themselves to the libertarian position on either of these two questions. Both avoided a clear commitment to pulling U.S. troops, all of them, out of the some 730 military bases now located in roughly 130 different countries around the globe. They evaded questions attempting to elicit clear positions on these two issues. On the drug question they both hid behinds states\u2019 rights: it is not a federal issue; they are running not for state but federal office; therefore, let the states decide. In any case, they would only commit themselves to medical marijuana, not its recreational use, and legalization of anything stronger would certainly be anathema to them. On foreign policy, they would only make \"major\" troop withdrawals, not total and complete ones.\n&gt;\n&gt;Since Ron Paul, a member of the Republican Party, not only embraces these two planks, but makes them central elements of his candidacy for that party\u2019s presidential nomination, we have arrived at an anomalous pass where a prominent member of the GOP is more libertarian than the two standard bearers of the LP.\n\nOn foreign policy, yes, I agree with you -- Ron Paul sounds more libertarian than these guys.  However, that's not the case for drug law.  He isn't advocating a nationwide requirement that states legalize drugs.  He simply wants to eliminate federal drug law and allow states to make what laws they want.  He's said that he personally views marijuana as \"probably very helpful\", but that's very different from taking a policy stance mandating that states allow drug usage.  Some states would probably *not* legalize anything, including marijuana -- his effect in those states would be limited to the removal of federal drug police from the picture.  I'm not familiar with the two libertarians that you mention, but their views and those of Ron Paul's WRT drugs, from your brief explanation, don't sound radically different.\n\n&gt;Another positive element of the 2008 LP Convention is that Barr will take more votes from McCain than Mary Ruwart would have. I am already on record as favoring socialist Obama over mad dog McCain, so this is all to the good.\n\nObama isn't socialist.  I don't particularly agree with his fiscal policy -- taking out a loan so that the ill today benefit at the expense of the ill tomorrow sounds like a bad idea to me -- but even the most fiscally-liberal nations in Europe are not really socialist.  With the exception of a few states like Cuba, socialism effectively died as a real-world institution during the last century.", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": true, "id": "c04718l", "parent_id": "t3_6ljpx", "ups": 2, "archived": true, "score": 2, "name": "t1_c04718l", "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_6ljpx", "distinguished": null, "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1425854816, "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Libertarian", "author": "generic_handle", "created_utc": "1212293090", "author_flair_css_class": null}

Why can't the public simply bring suit against the polluter?\n\nFor three reasons: 1) The public space requires a governing body to determine what is and is not public space. Forested areas and other highly productive areas can be very good arable land once cleared, but doing so incrementally damages the ecosystem. No one person is responsible for the whole of the damage, but as a whole society is. Wetlands are an unfortunate example of something that should have been defined as public space but was not originally. So, though private landholders have claim to these areas, they are restricted from building on them because doing so would do incremental damage to the ecosystem.\n\nWhich brings me to two, which further emphasizes incremental damage. 2) Because damage is often small and unnoticeable it can be easily hidden from view. It becomes very difficult to lay blame on any one individual or group for doing so. People who are not blatantly dumping poisons into water can still be causing damage, and you may not notice it until hundreds are responsible for the ultimate destruction.\n\nWhich brings me to 3)If damage is not restricted and prevented from happening *it is already done* even if you find the culprit. You can't bring back species that have gone extinct nor can your clean toxic water nor get back clear cut trees for habitat. The world becomes slowly less biodiverse, until small interdependencies you did not know existed start killing off things humans truly depend on.\n\n&gt;It's on Lew Rockwell's webiste\n\nSo its okay to just sit around circle jerking then?", "edited": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author": "kraemahz", "id": "c047dsg", "retrieved_on": 1425855047, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1212379797", "name": "t1_c047dsg", "link_id": "t3_6ln8c", "subreddit": "Libertarian", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0}

In a complex system, the results of any one action, or in this case loss of biodiversity, have unforeseen consequences. But just like overthrowing the democratically elected leader of Iran, the choice beforehand seems pretty clear: don't do it. I use that example because the future results of drastic foreign policy decisions are also murky and the outcomes usually don't go our way in the end after hindsight. In ecology, the loss of any important producer species or the stabilizing effect of a keystone species can throw the whole ecosystem of the area into chaos. Example: in New Mexico there was a small population of wolves keeping the wild population of grazers in check. The ranchers, obviously, did not like it when the wolves came and carried off one of their herd, so they shot them when they were on their property. The wolves of the area were ultimately eliminated, and the end result was the wild population of grazing animals had no more predation and began to eat everything in the area, leaving the plateau barren and then they began to die off when there was nothing left to eat. \n\nTo save the wolves, and thus the area, you have to either have a place for them to live that is public domain and fenced off from the private ranchers or an agreement with every rancher not to kill wolves. The latter simply does not work, any one rancher in the area can break rank (say his herd is particularly tasty to the wolves) and upset the whole ecosystem.\n\nBut it's even worse than that. In order to even figure out that the wolves are particularly important, you have to be able to study the dynamics of the region. Without a publicly claimed space, any biologist looking to study the biosystem would have to negotiate trespassing rights with every property owner in the region. Not only is this a bureaucratic nightmare (which disincentives people from wanting to do it in the first place), it is ultimately unfeasible in every situation. E.g. I negotiate with Ranchers A, B, and C: A and C say okay and B doesn't want anything to do with it. If B is on the route between A and C I can only cover A or C at one time, giving a tiny fraction of the original area to study.\n\nThe message is that you cannot trust that people are going to be rational or act with the best interests of the region in mind. The natural world does not respect property line boundaries, and with more and more people taking up the same amount of space it is simply unfeasible that you could keep them all from harming it *even if you did know everything about the system*. Since we do not know even that, we are required to be even more restrictive to protect every species' habitat, because any one of them could be very important.\n\nI realize I've strayed from topic, the issue is far too complex to summarize in a few paragraphs.

Despite all that, I still have a hard time agreeing with McCain.\n\nThe PATRIOT Act really sucks.  Yes, Obama voted for making it permanent, but at least there's the small mollification that he voted for some changes to it.  McCain didn't.\n\nIraq sucks.  Yes, Obama isn't going to withdraw, or return our military bases to the Iraqis, but I've seen estimates that his policies would put about half as many US soldiers in Iraq as McCain would.  That really sucks, but it's somewhat better than the alternative.\n\nThe article bashes Obama for imposing a carbon tax, and advocates McCain's approach -- a cap-and-trade system.  That's pretty absurd.  Emissions are an externality, and a carbon tax (particularly if used to pay for sequestration) internalizes those emissions.  Granted, carbon taxes would need to be globalized, since they're a world-wide shared resource, and I haven't seen a great proposal from anyone on that that I don't worry about a camel-getting-his-nose-in-the-tent sort of situation, but a carbon tax is not anti-market.  McCain is proposing a carbon-credit trading scheme.  In the past, when this was tried in Germany, it wound up being little more than a massive cash handout to a number of influential German companies.  It's a lot more abusable than a carbon tax is, from what I know of each.\n\nI'm really unhappy with Obama's universal health-care plan, which I view as essentially taking out a phenomenal loan to benefit those who are elderly today at the cost of those who are young today.  It will represent a huge ongoing expense, and will probably be a heavy target for future lobbying -- every company wants to mandate that their products be covered.  It will open the door to federal anti-obesity and similar policies, in the interests of reducing costs to the federal health care pool.  This is not fantasy -- these are actively proposed in Britain for exactly the reason of controlling NHS costs.  The arguments for it are also a little alarming.  I need health care, yes.  I also need food, shelter, transportation, and any number of other resources.  The universal health care plan explicitly deviates from things like Medicare in that it does not apply to merely the poor, but to *everyone* -- I had viewed poverty as the only possible justification for nationalization of health care policy, and Obama would break with this.\n\nObama's educational policy does not seem to be particularly more objectionable to me than anything that the Republicans have been advocating.\n\nI'm not familiar with the guts of Obama's trade policy; from the fairly vague statements on his website, there doesn't seem to be much commitment to any policies.  He advocates federal regulation net neutrality, which I still think is a profoundly bad idea, at least in the absence of an actual problem, and finally brings the federal government into the role of direct regulation of the Internet -- something that Bill Clinton generally (aside from a few porn prohibitions) fought against.  He'll raise the minimum wage, which screws over some of the poor, encourages the use of illegal labor, and has little other effect.  He wants to subsidize homeowners at the expense of non-homeowners, which seems rather regressive for a candidate who is often billed as being economically liberal, but I suppose any candidates will play to the current media events.  Some of the goals do not involve hard policy commitments, like \"encouraging businesses to do X\".\n\nBy-and-large, I don't see anything in the list of proposed policies that is horrendously objectionable.  Yes, he would expand the scope and weight of the federal government.  Yes, he perhaps got credit for things that he did not deserve credit for -- taking an \"anti-war\" image in particular, where Kucinich or Paul might deserve credit, but Obama really did not.\n\nObama is definitely no libertarian, but I haven't seen any commitments thus far that I really outright think would be catastrophic.  The worst are probably (a) adopting universal health care, particularly structured as a loan rather than a tax-sheltered savings program (I'd even be okay with redistributing wealth within a generation, but don't make it an inter-generational loan!), (b) net neutrality -- I don't want more regulation than is absolutely necessary, and there are untried market and technical solutions to the problem, even if it actually arises, (c) hard commitment to AIPAC to making Jerusalem the unified capital of Israel, which is a more pro-Israel approach than previous presidents have taken, and is obviously going to tick off much of the Middle East again.  Most of the rest of the issues are relatively minor warts or things that he won't do.  He isn't going to work on moving Social Security from a loan-structured system to a savings system, but that's not a huge surprise.  Bush tried that when his approval ratings were very high and had no luck.  It looks like the Obama administration will be yet another administration that maintains federal drug law -- ever since Carter, a lot of people have thought that change was just around the corner -- but McCain definitely isn't going to change this either.  He's undoubtedly going to hand out plenty of pork, but that's pretty much par for the course for administrations.\n\nAs some others have said -- yes, Obama will commit us to policies (UHC) that will be quite expensive in the long run.  But I believe that he will be somewhat less likely to prosecute war than McCain will, and war is one of the single most wasteful activities that we can engage in.  He has taken a somewhat better stance on civil liberties than McCain has during the Bush administration.\n\nIt kind of irks me that Obama's pushed for trying to increase the ties between Christianity and the Democratic Party, but it might be a good move for the party, I suppose.\n\nObama also improves on a number of Democratic stances.  He has not (unlike Hillary Clinton, who has irritated an awful lot of people with the Clinton history of gun bans) pushed to restrict Second Amendment rights.  I've read a couple articles from influential Democratic Party figures (Kerry being another) basically arguing that the Democratic Party should drop an anti-gun stance as a national issue -- that it is damaging in terms of voters -- and Obama seems to be on the same page.\n\nThe thing that really ticks me off is that [Russ Feingold](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Russ_Feingold), who I would view as decidedly preferable as a Democratic nominee to Obama, chose not to run in 2008.  He's taken strongly opposed stances on the PATRIOT Act and the Iraq invasion, pushed for full withdrawal and cutting war budget, pushed for a balanced national budget, is not particularly partisan, is in many ways fiscally conservative, is reasonable on gun rights, and strongly opposed the warrantless wiretapping.  He has liberal social values.  Not a fan of his views on UHC and a few other things, but I like him a lot more than Obama.  Where Kucinich had fantastic anti-war credentials, his views on gun ownership (i.e. nationwide handgun ownership ban) was a little alarming -- Feingold takes many of the same stances that I liked from Kucinich without most of the objectionable ones.  He's viewed as a bit of a maverick voter.  My cross-party dream ticket would have had him and Paul running together.\n\nOn the whole, though, I think that if you make a two-column list with McCain's pros on one side and Obama's pros on the other, Obama does pretty favorably.  Of course, Bush also advocated \"no nation-building\" when he was running for office, so we'll see what happens in the first term...\n\nOh, there is one last argument against Obama.  IMHO, one of the better states (and certainly the more fiscally-restrained) for the federal government to be in is deadlocked, with neither party in full control.  Bush saw Republican control of the Legislative and Executive branches.  The Democratic Party is a presidential election away from enjoying the same position.  That doesn't appeal to me quite as much as a two-party deadlock.", "controversiality": 0, "edited": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63"}

We don't need to give up our liberties to these organisations so they can protect us from climate change; we can choose to *empower* them for that purpose. However, people also need to be educated and made aware of environmental issues and what they can do about them, and encouraged to either do their part, or empower somebody else to.\n\nRegarding what you said about the government asking for more power to protect us from global warming, and its hypocrisy in how it treats corporations, I probably agree with the sentiment but I think it's a different issue. Personally I see government awareness &amp; education as the best solution from a libertarian perspective, since it encourages individual responsibility and reduces the reliance on the government to solve these problems for us.\n\nAside from the topic a little, do you think the government using your tax dollars for environmental projects is worthwhile? Do you think those projects would happen if the government taxed everyone a bit less and left it up to us?", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "retrieved_on": 1425857581, "edited": true, "archived": true, "id": "c04bmi3", "ups": 1, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "author": "gibs", "parent_id": "t1_c04blnk", "controversiality": 0, "link_id": "t3_6mt7s", "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "created_utc": "1213222134", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "Libertarian"}

The fruits of my labor are to be enjoyed by me and spent how I deem fit; not by some bureaucratic entity.  The government gets money for its programs by using the implied threat of force.  This is just like how the mafia operates except on a much larger scale and everyone pretends its ok.\n\nWhether or not the program is \"worthwhile\" is immaterial.  If I were to break into your house, steal your life savings (that maybe was to go to your children's continued education) and use it on a \"worthwhile\" cause would you not still be angered by it?  If I used that money to say, build a ramp for handicapped people, you'd physically see the ramp and people may hold me up as some sort of hero and champion for the handicapped.  What is unseen, however, is that your children would be lacking the education you worked for to provide them and the world would lose out on having more intelligent, thoughtful members of society.  The problem with assuming government programs are \"good\" is that the unseen is unaccounted for.  Maybe the dollars taken to fund the Iraq war would have been used by a private citizen or a company to advance a breakthrough in clean energy technology or to cure a disease or to help those in need.  We'll never know because government thieved the money and used it on something that was deemed worthwhile at the time.", "retrieved_on": 1425857589, "edited": true, "archived": true, "id": "c04bn0e"}

Mises was an Austrian Jew and because of \"Socialism\" the Nazis burnt down the library in Vienna where he worked (and the book was kept) and forced him to flee to the US.  Needless to say, it was a powerful and provocative work.  In \"Socialism,\" Mises basically destroys the idea that government (esp. a huge centralized one) will ever be able to effectively provide these services without huge limitations put on personal freedoms.\n\nBut to answer your points as short as possible I'd like to state:\n\n1) I believe taxation makes people far less generous and more selfish since it creates feeling of resentment between the groups the State blesses with the privilege to receive handouts and those that bear the expense of those handouts.\n\n2) If I were to give on the point that a little taxation was necessary (which I wouldn't), I'd still be completely against a central government spending the money to provide the services you mention.  If the government has to provide education, health care, etc., then it is best to be done at either a state or local level so those that wish to not take part in these programs can at least move to another part of the country.  Having them done federally allows for absolutely no economic freedom unless you're willing to move to another country.\n\n&gt;That is, I can't envision a society where the individuals have enough sense of personal responsibility to fund the important basic needs of others who can't afford them, and to proactively protect natural resources.\n\nWhat would come along with this economic freedom would also be the freedom to fail.  You'd see less extravagant lifestyles if people couldn't borrow money to finance living a lifestyle they can't afford.  Also, if companies were held liable for the property they damage, I'd imagine a few multi-million dollar lawsuits against polluters would introduce us to a lot more \"environmentally friendly\" corporations.", "retrieved_on": 1425857611, "name": "t1_c04bntk", "author_flair_text": null, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Libertarian", "created_utc": "1213228225", "link_id": "t3_6mt7s", "controversiality": 0, "distinguished": null, "score": 1, "gilded": 0, "parent_id": "t1_c04bngw", "author": "ryanh29", "ups": 1, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0}

I'm interested in someone actually trying the experiment (not where I live though).\r\n\r\n&gt;It is CERTAINLY possible to organize a successful democratic society along socialistic lines. There are multiple examples in the world today to show you that this is true.\r\n\r\nThat is the beauty of the federal republican system that was established in the founding of the United States. One State is free socialize and regulate every part of the lives of its citizens, if the citizens of that State are willing to cede their government that power. Another State might decide to, in your words, organize their society \"along libertarian lines\" and seek their own path to economic prosperity that is in line with the values and happiness of their citizens.\r\n\r\nAll this can be done without forcing their economic, social, and political philosophies on the rest of the republic, and the economic mistakes of people who espouse one philosophy don't have to bring everyone else down with them. Instead, in today's America, blanket decisions are made from Washington, by a barely accountable federal government, affecting (often negatively) the lives and economic prosperity of 300 million people.\r\n\r\nThe examples you mention of \"successful\" socialistic societies, have attained their level of success, precisely because there is local control. Norway is an example many who favor socialism point to as being what the US should aspire to, but Norway has less than 2% of the population of the United States (and unlike the US, Norway, being the world's third leading exporter of oil, has a disproportionately large amount of wealth, per capita).\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no historical or contemporary precedent for many of the socialist programs proposed at the federal level in the US. Programs like, for example, a universal health care system that has to provide quality care for 300 million people. The Soviets tried to implement such a system on a large scale, and failed miserably, to the extreme detriment of their people. The socialized medicine we already have (Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP, etc.) has been a catagoric failure, but together with Social Security, the world's largest \"entitlement\" program, it accounts for the majority of our federal (and state) spending.\r\n\r\nDespite the federal government's consistant track record of failure in these areas, people continue to advocate for the creation of new wasteful and ineffective socialist bureaucracies and federal, one-size-fits-all \"solutions\" to economic and social problems, which can really only be meaningfully and efficiently dealt with on the local level.", "retrieved_on": 1425860881, "link_id": "t3_6ok8e", "edited": true, "ups": 4, "score": 4}

If spacetime is a canvas in front of God, he can populate the canvas with spots of autonomous paint, watch what they do, and refrain from interfering if he wishes.

I suspect this is a spurious argument concocted by the very smart people working for the oil machine.\n\n", "retrieved_on": 1425861007, "link_id": "t3_6opw8", "gilded": 0, "author": "[deleted]", "distinguished": null, "controversiality": 0, "subreddit": "Libertarian", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1214321617", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "parent_id": "t1_c04gnfe", "id": "c04gnjj", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "archived": true, "name": "t1_c04gnjj"}

Deciding whether the problem is real should be a purely scientific question. There should be no correlation between opinions on the fact, and political views.\r\n\r\nLooking purely at the science, the fact is that the vast majority of climate scientists say it's for real. Most of the counter-arguments I've seen have been simplistic, misleading, or downright inaccurate. It's pretty easy to find debunks for them. So I'm convinced it's real, and a serious problem. We've had a fairly stable climate for the entire history of agriculture...a big change will not be pretty.\r\n\r\nSo, what to do about it. The first part is easy: quit using government force to support the oil companies.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, it gets harder for me, because I'm always looking for ways to keep government out of the picture entirely. An anarchist solution seems impossible with current technology, but a minarchist solution is another matter.\r\n\r\nIn figuring out the solution, we have to keep in mind the incentives for government itself. For example, there's way too much room in some cap/trade systems to give credits to the politically connected. Worse, a carbon tax would bring large sums of money to the government, thus giving government an incentive to make sure carbon emissions continue.\r\n\r\nA better solution would return carbon tax revenues as a rebate to citizens. People who conserve well would turn a profit.\r\n\r\nBut I think we can do even better than that. According to most scientists, we need to get to about zero emissions, soon, or we're screwed. So here's my idea:\r\n\r\n1) Various stories on reddit have talked about a machine just invented to efficiently remove carbon from the atmosphere. This would be measurable and verifiable. But we'd have to build millions of the contraptions.\r\n\r\n2) Government gives carbon credits to anyone who builds and operates these things, in an amount equal to the carbon they sequester.\r\n\r\n3) The sequestering companies auction off credits to highest bidders.\r\n\r\n4) Carbon emitters have to pay a tax to government for the carbon they emit, payable only in carbon credits. The tax rate is equal to the ratio between total emissions and total sequestration.\r\n\r\nNow there's no new money going to the government, and enormous economic incentive both to reduce emissions and build sequestration systems. Ultimately, the system should reach equilibrium, with as much carbon being sequestered as emitted.\r\n\r\nAnd all the government is really doing is issuing a new currency, with sequestration companies playing essentially the same role that federal reserve banks do now. What's more, that currency is backed by something real (tons of carbon sequestered), so it can't be arbitrarily inflated. \r\n", "link_id": "t3_6opw8", "created_utc": "1214331465", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit": "Libertarian", "author_flair_text": null, "name": "t1_c04gqio", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_6opw8", "id": "c04gqio", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "archived": true}

They'll still get their cut, so it's everyone who buys whatever union members create who loses out, including the union members themselves.  \n\nFor example, here's why American cars are junk; greedy unions have squeezed profits while automakers must compete with non-union-made Japanese cars.  Because labor costs are less for the Japs, they can use better quality parts and sell the cars at a decent price whereas more than half the price of every American car pays union pensions alone, meaning the only way for GM to profit is to replace quality parts with cheap junk from China or start building cars in Mexico, which of course means FEWER jobs in America.  Hey, thanks for the boost in unemployment numbers, unions!  \n\nUnions are gravy trains that favor the few at the expense of the many, and in that respect they're no better than the \"greedy capitalists\" themselves.  The big difference is the greedy capitalists aren't threatening to destroy if you don't CHOOSE to work for them, but unions DO threaten to destroy businesses if they don't fork over more than what people would freely CHOOSE to be paid to work there.  Ultimately, what unions achieve is increasing prices, trashing quality and decreasing # of total jobs.  \n\nOne last point... if everyone made $5 an hour because there were no unions, then a \"living wage\" would BE $5 an hour since that's what the majority earned.  The only reason milk is $5 a gallon now is because there's enough demand to support that price, courtesy of union-driven wage increases (and the omnipresent Fed dollar debasing, a much more important issue).  If we all abandoned unions and worked for $5 an hour, there'd be very little demand for milk at $5 a gallon, which would force milk producers to drop prices to sell their product.

Civil rights are rights that are bestowed by nations on those within their terr boundaries, while natural or human rights are rights that many scholars claim that individuals have by nature of being born. For example, the philosopher John Locke (1632\u20131704) argued that the natural rights of life, liberty and property should be converted into civil rights and protected by the sovereign state as an aspect of the social contract. Others have argued that people acquire rights as an inalienable gift from a deity (such as God) or at a time of nature before governments were formed.\n\nLaws guaranteeing civil rights may be written down, or derived from custom, or implied. In the United States and most continental European countries, civil rights laws are most often written. Examples of civil rights and liberties include the right to get redress if injured by another, the right to privacy, the right of peaceful protest, the right to a fair investigation and trial if suspected of a crime, and more generally-based constitutional rights such as the right to vote, the right to personal freedom, the right to freedom of movement and the right of equal protection. As civilizations emerged and formalized through written constitutions, some of the more important civil rights were granted to citizens.

This in affect violates the non-aggression pact right away. By simply using the guns of government to shield irresponsible members of a business from any damages they might accrue is immoral and wrong. It also distorts the marketplace. If a company knew from the outset that it would be held liable on an individual basis for all the actions of its management and employees, the business would run differently (in my opinion more efficiently and consumer friendly). but because they know that the government will protect the individuals within that company, they can throw caution to the wind and allow the investors to take the hit.\n\nUnions on the other hand are a mixed bag. If a group of workers wants to collectively bargain they should be more than free to do so. But it should be left up to the employer whether or not he wants to listen to their demands. He should have the right to fire his workforce (or not) and rehire with the type of worker he wants to work for him. It is when unions and government get together to make demands that the business man cannot turn down because they have guns pointed at them. This makes the business less competitive and raises everyone's standard of living. Union people have to realize that a job is a privilege not a right. And Union members have this sentiment backwards. they think that once they get a job they have a right to it until they retire, then they have a right to a pension, and they have a right for vacation ect ect.

These Labor-Corporations, operating in a manner conceptually similar to temp agencies, would then sell labor contracts to product producing companies.  For example, Joe Shmo would work for Comp-Tech-Workers-Global.  CTWG in turn would have a contract with AT&amp;T to provide 571 full time qualified computer workers in the LA area per year from 2071-2076.  CTWG is a labor corporation.  AT&amp;T is a product-corporation.  These labor-corporations could be employee owned like a labor union, but they wouldn't have to be.  I envision them as for-profit entities.  \n\nAn individual worker would not be locked into to supporting a coercive monopoly labor union, because he could always switch to a competing labor-corporation.  A product-company could not be forced into bankruptcy by its own employee-union because they too could switch to a different labor supply company.  A labor-corporation would have multiple contracts with multiple companies so they couldn't be strong armed by any one client product-company.  Lastly, the employee is ultimately paid by his labor-corporation not the product-producing-company that his labor is contracted to.  Consequently, he has all the job security of a union employee.  The product-company that consumes the products of his labor *can't* fire him, they can only request that the labor company that, they contract with, and that he works for, send someone else.  The labor-corporation can fire him if his skills are unmarketable, but they will have equal incentive to train him in more marketable skills.  The MCLC model protects everyone's interests, especially the employee's.\n\nAlso, in the MCLC (Multiple Competing Labor-Corporations) model, many of the HR activities that are part of being an employer, and yet irrelevant to the business models of most companies (health insurance, continuing education, unemployment insurance, etc) would all be the responsibility of the labor-corporation which is actually employing the workers.  This makes sense, because it is in their own best interests to optimize the value of their employees... the skills, and health of their employees is fundamental to their product: selling the labor of motivated, educated, healthy, skilled people to companies that want to use that labor to make products.  For example, it would be in the interest of these labor corporations to subsidize education of their employees, after all if someone has multiple specialties, it makes their skills more marketable increasing their value to the labor-corporation.  This same principle makes workers who don't work for a labor-corporation perfectly harmless to the system as a whole since the labor corporations are specialized in providing HR to employees and thus can gain economies of scale doing so.  It will always cost the product-producing-company more on a per-employee basis to to provide such benefits.  This may be worth the cost in some instances.  But the whole system is not threatened by the presence of non-labor-corporation employees the way non-union employees threaten the union system.\n\nLikewise, issues such as good working conditions would be served by the MCLC model.  A set of industry standard work conditions would be rapidly formed because it would be in the best interests of all labor-corporations within an industry to cooperate on such things.

If it is extremist, it is only that in response to the extreme nature of government, which has historically taken a mile whenever it is given an inch.\r\n\r\nYour argument, the so-called \"social-contract\" doctrine, is based one the notion that I owe society (by which, you mean the government; I would say society is something very different from just the government, but whatever) that for which I have worked, because it is through society (again, e.i., the government) that I am even able to work and prosper. This ideology, in turn, is based on the (unfounded) assumption that everything that is to be funded with my taxes is a better, more necessary investment in society as a whole, than what I would have done with it.\r\n\r\nWhat people who favor socialized government programs often fail to recognize, is that to remove capital from the market to invest in government bureaucracy, along with the associated price distortions of doing so, often decimates the ability for the market to provide better solutions to the same problems, that are more affordable, efficient, and virtually universally excessable. To tax people in order to open the door to this or that government solution, more often than not, closes the door on a superior free market solution.\r\n\r\nNow, I am more lenient in my beliefs when talking about government action that is performed on a *very* local level, at which an individual has some real ability to affect change (or at least move away, if need be), which is the only situation where the notion of a \"social-contract\" could ever really be legitimate.

A monopoly in the hands of the workers in the case of the union model, or in the hands of the employers in the case of the non-union model.  *Either way* there is a labor monopoly.\n\nThat's where MCLC differs from mutualism (as I understand it).  In MCLC, no individual labor-corporation ever has a monopoly on labor within a given industry; it is always competing with other labor-corporations.  \n\nWe know that this business model can work because a lot of IT companies already work in approximately this mode: They have a series of products/services such as database-installations, or web-servers, that they maintain for a paying customer.  If the product suffers a flaw, or needs to be reconfigured, the IT company sends someone to do it and bills his time back to the paying customer.  \n\nThe only difference is that, in the MCLC model, the labor-company provides skilled employees as it's *only* product.  This is advantageous for all parties because it means the IT-company can focus on actually building software.

Trolling is an art of great subtlety.\n\nSeriously now. Veksler's characterization of environmentalism goes too far.

It is cheap and efficient to maintain a polluting industry and polluting lifestyle. This is because the damage we cause to the environment can have no significant impact on us yet be a complete disaster to other organisms on the planet, who are not a part of human trade system and thus have no direct influence on human cost and efficiency calculations. \n\nEnvironmentalism is not just a matter of costs, but also one of morality and aesthetics. Environmentalist thought assumes obligations before the nature itself without ostensibly reciprocal benefit. Economists would find such obligations frivolous because they have zero rationale from economists' perspective. Environmentalism proposes to integrate the environmental concerns into the industrial complex, permanently injecting the environmentalist thought into economics, which for austrian economists (who are strict anti-collectivists) looks like an attempt to use the power of state to coerce everyone to act irrationally on the market, which is probably the worst nightmare for an austrian economist.

We are eliminating species, we are changing climate, we poison seas and soil and we pollute the environment. However, science can't tell economists how much does it cost us. According to the austrian school, causing damage to the environment should be seen as a violation of property rights. Animals, plants and other living things **do not have rights** under the libertarian thought, the exact opposite of environmentalist approach.

A democracy is only as effective as its voters.  That's why Bush has a second term :)\n\n&gt; Well, London is now less polluted now than a century ago. \n\nOf course it is. Industrial production has mainly been moved out of USA and Europe, and industry is the big polluter in cities.\n\n&gt; Particularly, the pollution can be solved by rigorous definition of property rights, and treating pollution as trespassing.\n\nHow does that work?  Could we then treat a plane flying over our house as a trespasser and demand tolls? What about the oceans, which aren't owned? Do we assign an owner to every cubic meter of ocean? It seems a bit naive to think that private property will solve all these problems magically.\n\n&gt; I'll take that if that means less poverty on the whole.\n\nThere are two types of poverty, really: absolute and relative. Absolute poverty has to do with getting the basic essentials of life like food and shelter and clean water and health care.  Relative poverty has to do with a person's perception of their wealth relative to their society.  Some things are also in the middle, like access to education.  Market forces are good at eliminating absolute poverty for a large part of the population because starving people can't work. But they fail to help those who can't work or produce, and they increase the gap between the rich and poor, increasing relative poverty.  A blended economy with state services funded by a progressive tax is good at getting rid of the corners of absolute poverty as well as reducing the relative poverty.\n\nI'll give you that Iceland was nicer than Norway prior to its incorporation into the Norwegian (and later Danish) kingdoms.  But I don't think it should be used as a political model today.\n\n&gt; Look, be honest. What so hard about vote counting?\n\nAsk Florida and Ohio.  But seriously, if the democratic process is primarily seen as a way to look legitimate rather than a way to _be_ legitimate, then it's misimplemented.\n\n&gt; Sure. That why I think that West was fortunate to get those traditions and respect for property rights before it has got a full-blown democracy.\n\nAgreed, with the qualifier that property rights need not be seen as absolute rights. They're a good tool to use, but not the be-all and end-all of social organization.\n", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "subreddit": "Libertarian", "archived": true, "retrieved_on": 1425861971, "link_id": "t3_6ok8e", "distinguished": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author": "kikaerter"}

A power monopoly by an elite is just asking to be dominated by them.\n\nAbout the planes: could I demand tolls for planes over my house in this model?

I don't buy it.  Also, I don't buy that homesteading is a workable model for the oceans, for a number of reasons, including:\n\n* Water is constantly flowing, making any ocean property _very_ dependent on the actions of neighbors\n\n* The types of resources typically extracted from the ocean, i.e. fish, typically move around a lot.  Who owns them?  This is a greater concern with the ocean, as fish are likely to be a primary source of income, while land itself has productive value that is stationary (crops and minerals, for example).\n\n* Homesteading, where a person is given something in exchange for using and improving it, makes little sense in a ocean, where any \"development\" would probably be counterproductive, especially deeper parts of the ocean where one can't build windmills.\n\n* The oceans are so vast and thinly populated by humans that tracing violations of property would be much less practical than on land.\n\n&gt; First, market forces do no hate poor people. Hell, they do not any have (anthropomorphic) motives at all. \n\nAgreed.  But so far as I can see, they keep some people poor, and this poverty can be reduced through blending tax-funded social services with a market economy.\n\n&gt; And if Joe Brown cannot work/produce are really the markets to blame? Obviously he has to leave at the expense of those to work and produce, there's no way around it.\n\nThe markets are not to blame for him not being able to work, but the social relationship of a purely-market economy and society has excluded him from the possibility of having basic needs (and some not-so-basic needs like education) met.  A welfare state allows Joe to be able to get these things, and maybe even train himself into a job that he can perform, even though he started out poor and without marketable skills.\n\n&gt; Your point being?\nThat through a balanced set of social institutions, we can reduce both rather than just one. As we've seen in Scandinavia, for example, where few are poor, few are rich, and the general standard of living is very high.\n\n&gt; And the logic behind this reasoning is... Might (majority) makes right?\n\nNo, the logic is that property is a social institution like any other.  It has its uses and drawbacks.  Uses include motivating higher levels of efficiency and providing for stability in the lives of those fortunate enough to have property.  Drawbacks include inequality and power imbalances. Limiting property rights through taxes, outlawing large inheritances, and giving rights to workers give you much of the benefit while relieving some of the drawbacks. It's not might makes right any more than the institution of property is.\n\n_edit_ god damn markdown", "edited": true, "gilded": 0, "name": "t1_c04i6li"}

Mine property is mine, not yours. Sorry. it has to be said.\n\n&gt; It has its uses and drawbacks.

I used Sweden as a sarcastic example in that case (as in, after someone remarks on milk being spicy, I then claim that they must think water is like cinnamon).\n\n&gt; nobody else has an interest in that area\n\nThe problem with that is that we all have a collective interest in the biology of the ocean as a whole, but few individuals have an interest in the health of a small part of it. Hence the similarity to air and the difficulty of using property rights to protect our collective interest in not dieing off following an ecological collapse of the ocean.\n\n&gt; So, again, if Joe Brown is not able to work and produce, he has to live at the expense of some other people, who are able to work.

It would be even easier without minimum-wage laws (for really poor-skilled Joes) and expensive and lengthy state-imposed education for young and ambitious Joes.\n\nSome Joes will be able to do this.

Just like preventing parents from starving them.\n\n&gt; No it's not. Mine property is mine, not yours. Sorry. it has to be said.\n\nI think this is the kernel of the matter, can we focus on it?  Where does the right to property come from? Where does any right come from?  Here's my take:\n\nA right is a social institution created for the protection of an interest that is deemed to be important.  For example, the right to a free press protects our interest in an informed population and the American right to bear arms is to protect the people's interest in threatening the State with violence. The right to property protects our interest in making people productive, with the justification for copyright and patents being similar. Do you see a different source for rights?\n\n&gt; I do know very little, about Scandinavia, so I'll rather not discuss it.\n\nI live in Denmark, so it's easy for me to discuss it.  I'll try to stick to more priciple-oriented discussions if you'd like, though.\n\nI'm enjoying this discussion! I hope you are too."}

I'm really interested in the Celts though so I'd like to hear what you find attractive about their culture / government.\n\n\"In Celtic Irish society of the Middle Ages and Early Modern period, courts and the law were largely anarchist, and operated in a purely stateless manner. This society persisted in this manner for roughly a thousand years until its conquest by England in the seventeenth century. Preconquest Ireland was not in any sense \"primitive\": it was a highly complex society that was, for centuries, the most advanced, most scholarly, and most civilized in all of Western Europe. A leading authority on ancient Irish law wrote, \"There was no legislature, no bailiffs, no police, no public enforcement of justice... There was no trace of State-administered justice.\"\n\n\"Medieval Iceland had no bureaucrats, no taxes, no police, and no army. \u2026 Of the normal functions of governments elsewhere, some did not exist in Iceland, and others were privatized, including fire-fighting, criminal prosecutions and executions, and care of the poor.\"\n\n\"Medieval Icelandic institutions have several peculiar and interesting characteristics; they might almost have been invented by a mad economist to test the lengths to which market systems could supplant government in its most fundamental functions. Killing was a civil offense resulting in a fine paid to the survivors of the victim. Laws were made by a \"parliament,\" seats in which were a marketable commodity. Enforcement of law was entirely a private affair. And yet these extraordinary institutions survived for over three hundred years, and the society in which they survived appears to have been in many ways an attractive one . Its citizens were, by medieval standards, free; differences in status based on rank or sex were relatively small; and its literary, output in relation to its size has been compared, with some justice, to that of Athens.\"", "score": 2, "author": "Atomics", "archived": true, "retrieved_on": 1425862321, "distinguished": null, "author_flair_css_class": null}
