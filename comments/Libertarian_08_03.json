The point is although non-coercion is preferable, balanced, mutual forms of coercion are preferable to unilateral ones. If I am forced to pay costs (like an insurance company) if the house of my neighbor burns down I will try to force him not to smoke in his own house. This is rational and not unethical because the whole situation isn't ethical either. \n\nAs long as we are paying welfare to people who f**k up their lives, banning drugs and disincentiving tobacco and alcohol is preferable to not doing so. \n\nEliminate welfare and most or all of the taxes, leave my property alone, bear the costs of your own decisions and I won't care whether you smoke tobacco, pot, crack or rat poison. (I mean not in the legal sense. I would try to convince you not to smoke crack and rat poison out of basic human compassion, of course.)\n\nLibertarianism isn't libertinism.
